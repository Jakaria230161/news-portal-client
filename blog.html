                            <strong>Regular Functions VS Regular Functions : </strong>
                            <p> .1) Syntax:
                            A programmer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow functions.
                            
                            Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.</p>
                            <p>2) Arguments binding
                            arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments.The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn’t define arguments i.e. they do not have arguments binding.But you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest parameter ...args.</p>
                            <p>3) Use of this keyword
                            Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the value of this depends
                            on how the function is invoked.The behavior of this inside of an arrow, function differs considerably from the regular function’s this behavior as an
                            arrow function does not have its own “this” keyword.The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound
                            to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function which means No matter how or where being executed, this
                            value inside of an arrow function always equals this value from the outer function.
                            </p>
                            <p>4) Using a new keyword
                            Regular functions are constructible and callable. They can be called using the new keyword.But, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be used as constructor
                            functions</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>Summary
                            this value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on how the function is invoked. But this inside the arrow
                            function is bound lexically and equals to this of the outer function. Fat arrow methods always bind this a value to the
                            class instance.

                            <p>1. The returning value
                            The first difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value. The forEach() method returns undefined and
                            map() returns a new array with the transformed elements. Even if they do the same job, the returning value remains
                            different.</p>
                            <p>2. Ability to chain other methods
                            The second difference between these array methods is the fact that map() is chainable. This means that you can attach
                            reduce(), sort(), filter() and so on after performing a map() method on an array.
                            
                            That's something you can't do with forEach() because, as you might guess, it returns undefined.</p>
                            <p>3. Mutability
                            In general, the word "mutate" means change, alternate, modify or transform. And in the JavaScript world it has the same
                            meaning.
                            
                            A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. So, what about forEach and map regarding
                            mutability?
                            
                            Well, according to the MDN documentation:
                            
                            forEach() does not mutate the array on which it is called. (However, callback may do so).
                            
                            map() does not mutate the array on which it is called (although callback, if invoked, may do so).
                            
                            JavaScript is weird.Well, in my opinion, this definition is not clear though. And to know which does not mutate the original array, we first
                            have to check how these two methods work.
                            
                            The map() method returns an entirely new array with transformed elements and the same amount of data. In the case of
                            forEach(), even if it returns undefined, it will mutate the original array with the callback.
                            
                            Therefore, we see clearly that map() relies on immutability and forEach() is a mutator method.</p>
                            <p>4. Performance Speed
                            Regarding performance speed, they are a little bit different. But, does it matter? Well, it depends on various things
                            like your computer, the amount of data you're dealing with, and so on.
                            
                            You can check it out on your own with this example below or with jsPerf to see which is faster.</p>
